 ## Design Choices

### inspiration

[This site](http://www.instagram.com/free.licious) was inspired for the number of my choices when creating the website/background and images.

### Icons


* I used Font Awesome icons for my social media link icons in my footer / that is a visual way to indicate  users how to access social media pages.

### Header section
- Drawing from the main Freelicious site, images as backgrounds were suggested and I felt this would have a positive impact on users first arriving to the website. The call for action and recommendation of what is common for good websites in general to ensure good UX performance. In terms of implementing the background images, [I used this social site for inspiration](http://www.instagram.com/free.licious).


### Information section

-  Inspiration for the design for this website i got from [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtXGz0MBuqZUC8rmGddc07Q). This design is for service information. Since I thought that the application that’s on offer is a type of service, I felt this design could be a good way to explain the concept to users as easily as possible. Especially, since the concept is new for Cake Studio and cake orders from online , it is very important to have a design that can clearly convey information.

## Wireframes

- I used the Balsamiq tool to create my wireframe. I made one Balsamiq wireframe file that has wireframe png images of the idea on desktop and mobile. The reason that this wireframe was my initial thoughts were how the design of the webpage would look like in the end of my project.
