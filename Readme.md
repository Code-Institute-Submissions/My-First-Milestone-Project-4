 ## Design Choices

### inspiration

[This site](http://www.instagram.com/free.licious) was inspired for the number of my choices when creating the website/background and images.

### Icons


* I used Font Awesome icons for my social media link icons in my footer / that is a visual way to indicate  users how to access social media pages.

### Header section
- Drawing from the main Freelicious site, images as backgrounds were suggested and I felt this would have a positive impact on users first arriving to the website. The call for action and recommendation of what is common for good websites in general to ensure good UX performance. In terms of implementing the background images, [I used this social site for inspiration](http://www.instagram.com/free.licious).


### Information section

-  Inspiration for the design for this website i got from [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtXGz0MBuqZUC8rmGddc07Q). This design is for service information. Since I thought that the application that’s on offer is a type of service, I felt this design could be a good way to explain the concept to users as easily as possible. Especially, since the concept is new for Cake Studio and cake orders from online , it is very important to have a design that can clearly convey information.

## Wireframes

- I used the Balsamiq tool to create my wireframe. I made one Balsamiq wireframe file that has wireframe png images of the idea on desktop and mobile. The reason that this wireframe was my initial thoughts were how the design of the webpage would look like in the end of my project.

## Testing Freelicious Website

* To test the website I used the following validators:

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) for HTML I've put the code in the validator and first it was showing me two Parse Error.
  * The first error was At line 292, column 17 which was (<h5>&copy; freelicious.co.)
  * The second error showing me was At line 306, column 8 which was (body>↩↩↩</html>↩)
  * After i did format selection in HTML the error wasn't seen anymore.

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) for CSS I've put the code into the validator. No errors were were found upon final check.

## User Testing
* As a new wisitor to the website i wanted to see what's the purpose of it.
  -  User initially lands on Header section, making it quite clear what the website relates to (Cake Studio) so the user knows right away that the purpose of it is Cake Bakery.
  -  The purpose of the website is extended with a description right below the slide images and in the section in (About Us).

*  As a new visitor of the website, I would like some inspiration from the Bakery what sort of cakes i can order
   -  The user is directed towards the Menu section where he can choose the potencial cake or he can choose as well from the Gallery.

* As a potential customer/observer, I want social media links available so I can easily access to social network activity.

  -  The social media links are related in the bottom of the page where visitor can get to them and become active on them, subscribe on them and follow us from there.

* As a visitor, I want to be able to get in touch with the website owner

  -  An address and phone number are provided in the bottom of the page as mentioned before the social media links can be as a contact the owner as well.

   * Logged into GitHub
   
   * Under the tab 'Repositories', I selected My First Milestone Project

   * Then I selected 'Settings' from the menu at the top of the page

   * I scrolled down the page to the GitHub Pages section
